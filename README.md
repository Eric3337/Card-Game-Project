# Chinese Card Game

## By Eric Zhang

This application will allow users to play a fun card game 
with their friends and family. The card game is based off 
on a card game that my parents and family members
played with me when I was a boy. My speculations are that
the card game is not available online since
not many people have even heard of the name of the card
game, which means that an online version of it has 
probably not been made. Therefore, I would like to 
take on that challenge and hopefully make it a multiplayer
game one day. (**however**, for now, it'll just be single player)

The arbitrary list idea would be that  the game is
able to make a new player name/account and there can 
be an arbitrary number of accounts/players in this game. 
For example, having a list of an object 
accounts that has the statistics of players (ex: win/lost ratios)(this one is 
likely to be helpful with multiplayer systems, that's
just my own idea when i want to expand on this project)

The arbitrary list can *also* be the history of moves/games that
the player has done, which can also be arbitrary.

The cards can be represented as a list or a hashset 
where the system can look through it easily.
